# repo-login

repo-login is a React application built using Create React App, designed to demonstrate basic React functionality. The project incorporates popular React libraries such as `react-router-dom`, `react-icons`, and others to build a modern, interactive user interface. To get started, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Sritam-mahapatra/repo-login.git`, then navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. After installation, start the development server with `npm start`, and the app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Before running the project, ensure that **Node.js** (version 14 or later) and **npm** are installed on your system. The project is structured with `public/` containing static assets, `src/` containing source code and components, and `package.json` for managing dependencies and scripts. This app is built with React, React Router for routing, React Icons for iconography, and npm as the package manager. The project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE), and contributions are welcome through pull requests or by opening issues on GitHub.
